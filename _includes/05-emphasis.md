I have a master degree in **Russian literature and language studies** and a fluent speaker both in **Russian and English**. I can use some professional CAT softwares and occassionally get some paid job as a **translator**. But since I'm bad with people and hold a strange moral standard, so still find it hard to make a living without destroying myself. Still working on that by reading, thinking and experiencing in everyday life. In the near future, hope to find a way to express myself on a regular basis in order to connect to the world and get better. Hopefully,also make some friends and pick up useful skills along the way. Fingers crossed!
By the way, I'm always interested in programming, technics and methodology to be efficient. Time is my most precious asset, after all.
